# DereGunGame
DereGunGame is an EXILED plugin that adds the GunGame gamemode to your server. It is completely customizable, and allows you to create exclusive levels to make each round unique.

## Gun Game (Or Golden Gun)
The gamemode is inspired from Call Of Duty's "Gun Game". The premise is really ismple: *each time you kill a player, you get a new weapon. Get a kill with every weapon to win.*

### Humiliations
When you spawn, you also get always a Jailbird. Killing a player with that melee weapon will remove a fixed amount of points from their progress. Use it to change drastically the leaderboard and push back a top player.
When killing with the Jailbird, you will not be granted a point. Therefore making only humiliations will not make you win.

Humiliations will also happen when you kill yourself, by falling down or with a grenade.

## Rounds and Spawnpoints
Each round takes place in one of the 4 zones (you can also specify which zones you want in the config). Spawnpoints are calculated smartly, to avoid spawning a player in the middle of a fight between others. You can setup a spawn radius to adjust this value.

## Special Thanks
I would like to thank Matteoninja, Sir.Simoo (Lo 096 infuriato) and .cuaio and the members of the OmegaSCP community for helping out in testing the gamemode. Without your help and feedback I would've never managed to find a lot of bugs <3
